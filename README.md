# Brain Tumor Detection using CNNs

Brain tumors are among the most dangerous forms of cancer, often requiring early detection and treatment. **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)** is a key technique used by radiologisits to visualize the brain in high 3 Dimensional detail.
In this project, I aim to leverage a Deep CNN architecture to carry out segmentation of brain tumors usig multi-modal MRi scans.
